## Discussion 2

In the video (Music Recommendations at Scale with Spark), Christopher explains different types of recommendation strategies used by companies, including manual curation, manual tagging based on attributes, automated content-based methods, and collaborative filtering. Each of these has its own pros and cons depending on the user's needs and the type of recommendation being made. I found it interesting music companies may want to hire someone and tag each attributes of their music which is time consuming. 

Christopher then goes and explains the two different types of matrix factorization. Explicit matrix factorization uses user-provided ratings to predict missing ratings such as movies.Implicit matrix factorization is inferring what the user will like. Data is represented in binary number where 1 means the user interacted with the item and 0 means they didnâ€™t. The confidence level is weighted by how often the user interacted with the item.

To factorize the matrix, Alternating Least Squares (ALS) is used, which breaks down the user-item matrix into two smaller matrices representing user and item characteristics.

It was the most interesting to find out the three ways the same data can be processed and have significant difference in the processing time. 

Hadoop - Takes the longest because broadcasting and grouping are more manual and involve a lot of data shuffling across machines.

Spark (Full Gridify) - Splits the data into blocks and computes all blocks in parallel, reducing data shuffling and improving speed.

Spark (Half Gridify) - Focuses only on the relevant parts of the data that need processing, which makes it more efficient and faster than full gridify.
